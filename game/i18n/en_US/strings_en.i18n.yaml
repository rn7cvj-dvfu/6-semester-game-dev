        text: "When multiple vertices are connected by edges, they form a graph — a structure that represents relationships between elements."

        title: "Stage 2: Path Length"
        richText(rich): "The length of a path is the number of edges in that path. For example, the length of the path from the ${redNode(red)} vertex to the ${blueNode(blue)} vertex is 2, since there are two edges between them."
